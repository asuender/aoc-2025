# aoc-2025

An attempt to solve all 12 puzzles from 2025s Advent of Code. I will try to keep up with the pace of each new puzzle being published every day, but I cannot make any promises.

## Usage

Each folder inside `day<NUM>/` corresponds to the puzzle of that day. Each folder holds an `example.txt` and `data.txt` file to test on dummy and "real" data. To switch between them, find the line inside `part01.py` or `part02.py` that loads them and replace them accordingly.
